Privacy Policy
Last updated: December 31, 2014
GameStop knows that you care about your
    privacy and the use of your personal information. This notice describes our
    Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy
    applies to information we collect about you from any source â through our
    Websites, in our retail stores, through our Power-Up Rewardsâ¢ Program, in any
    contest or promotion, or any other way. 


By visiting a GameStop Website or
    retail store, participating in our PowerUp Rewardsâ¢ Program, or otherwise
    providing information to GameStop you are accepting the practices described in
    this Privacy Policy.

    In this Privacy Policy, "GameStop" means GameStop, Inc., its Websites and its
    retail stores located in the United States, Guam, and Puerto Rico. "Website(s)" means GameStop operated
    websites and mobile applications, including GameStop.com and PowerUpRewards.com. Our Websites may contain links to other
    websites. GameStop is not
    responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to
    other GameStop brands such as BuyMyTronics, Game
    Informer, Kongregate, or PC Downloads, each of which
    has its own privacy policy. The
    word "computer" means any device used to connect to a Website,
    including, but not limited to, mobile devices.
We Gather the Following Personal
    Information About Customers:
Information That You Give Us: We receive and store any information
    you enter on our Websites or that you give us in any other way. You can choose
    not to provide certain information, but this will limit your ability to
    purchase products offered on the Websites, or to take advantage of some
    features or promotions.

    When you place an order with us online, in a store or in any other way, your
    contact information is used to communicate related information, such as order
    and shipment confirmation, release date changes and requests for more
    information to facilitate processing your order. You may opt-out of these
    communications by canceling your order.

    We use customer contact information to customize future shopping for you, to
    improve our Websites and stores, to send you information about our company, and
    to inform you of sales and special offers. If, after receiving a non-order
    related email, you do not want to receive such emails in the future, you can
    notify us by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link attached to each
    email.
We obtain information about you when
    you search, buy, participate in a contest or questionnaire, communicate with
    customer service, or otherwise contact us or post information on our Websites.
    For example, you provide information when you search for a product; place an
    order through a Website or provide information to update or create your account
    with us (you may have more than one account if you have used more than one
    email address when shopping with us); communicate with us by phone, email, or
    otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; create any wish or
    gift list; participate in any forums or discussion areas or product reviews; or
    create any alerts or other email notification services we may offer now or in
    the future. The information collected typically includes your name, address,
    and phone numbers; credit card information; people to whom purchases have been
    shipped, including addresses and phone number; content of reviews you may
    provide; emails to us; and any other personal information that you provide to
    us or post on the Websites.
We occasionally run our own email
    surveys and we ask visitors
    for contact, demographic and technical information. We use contact data from
    our surveys to send users information about our company. This information is
    also used to contact visitors to learn more about specific problems they might
    have reported or to give them rewards, if such a reward program is part of the
    survey. The demographic information is used to learn more about the types of
    people who visit our site.
We run contests in which we ask
    visitors for contact information (such as their email address). We use this information to
    contact the winners. We may also use or share contest information with our
    business and marketing partners to offer you products or services that we
    believe may be of interest to you.

We allow customers to post reviews and allow visitors to communicate
    information on products. When posting a review, you can optionally display your
    name, an alias, or remain anonymous. However, if you disclose personally
    identifiable information in your review, that information is public information
    and may increase your chance of receiving unsolicited email. You should use
    discretion when disclosing information online.

Automatic Collection of Information: If you purchase any products
    online, or have any other interaction with our Websites, we will receive and
    store information that you provide or that is generated by your actions. We may also send you personalized emails. These communications may contain links
    to our Websites that could include unique identifiers capable of correlating
    any resulting web activity to the originating email communication. Like many websites, we may use tracking
    pixels/web beacons, "cookies", or other technologies to receive and
    store certain information, and this information may also be used by certain
    third-party advertisers with which we have agreements. Our relationship with third-party
    advertisers is discussed in more detail under the heading "Third-Party
    Advertising" below. For example,
    cookies are placed on your computer (explained in more detail below) to
    remember your name and the contents of your shopping cart. This allows you to
    leave our site, come back later, and still have the contents of your shopping
    cart intact. It also lets us personalize your experience at our Websites,
    tailoring the content to your interests. A number of companies offer utilities
    designed to help you visit websites anonymously, but if you use these utilities,
    it may limit your ability to use personalized features that we offer.

    The information we receive or can determine from your interaction with our Websites
    includes your Internet (IP) address; login and password information; email
    address; web browser type and version; operating system and computer platform;
    purchase history, which we may aggregate with similar information from other
    customers; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and
    from our Websites, including date and time; one or more unique identifiers;
    products you viewed or searched for; areas of our Websites you visited; and the
    phone number you used to call our toll-free number. We also may log the length
    of time of your visit and the number of times you visit and purchase from us.
    We assign you one or more unique identifiers to help keep track of your future
    visits

Email Communications: We provide email links on our "Customer
    Services" page that allow you to contact us directly with any questions or
    comments you may have. We may receive a confirmation when you open any email
    that we send to you, if your computer supports such capabilities. If you send
    us any email, we will retain such email and your email address for response. We
    also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in
    an effort to avoid sending unnecessary or duplicate messages to you.

Information from Other Sources: If we receive any information about you
    from other sources, we may add it to our account information. For example, if
    we receive a list of subscribers to a gaming publication, and we note that you
    are a subscriber, we may include that information in the account information
    that we store about you. Other examples of information we receive from other
    sources include updated delivery and address information from our carriers or
    other third parties, which we use to correct our records; account information,
    purchase or redemption information, and page-view information from business
    partners who operate their own websites or for which we provide any services;
    search term and search result information from searches conducted through the
    website; and credit history information from credit bureaus, which we use to
    help prevent and detect fraud.

An Explanation of "Cookies"
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers
    that are placed by us on your computer's storage system through your web
    browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser when you make future
    visits to our Websites, and to store certain information (such as items placed
    in your shopping cart) between visits.

    You can stop your computer from storing cookies if you want to. Most browsers
    will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to
    have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
    cookies altogether. You should look in the "help" area shown on your
    browser's toolbar. Because cookies allow you to have the benefit of our
    personalized features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. You MUST
    have cookies enabled in order to checkout on our Websites.

We or our partners may also use Flash
Cookies (also known as Local Stored Objects) or other similar technologies. A
Flash Cookie is a small data file placed on a computer using Adobe Flash or
similar technology that may be built into your computer or downloaded or
installed by you to your computer. We use these technologies to personalize and
enhance your online experience, facilitate processes, personalize and store
your settings. Flash cookies may help our Website visitors to, for example, set
volume preference associated with a video experience, play games and perform
surveys. They help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of
greatest interest to customers. They may be recognized by other sites or by our
marketing or business partners. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies and the cookie
    management tools provided by your browser may not remove Flash cookies. Click here to learn how
    to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies. If you disable Flash
    cookies or other similar technologies, please be aware that you may not have
    access to certain features and services that make your online experience more
    efficient and enjoyable.
Sharing of Information
Tournaments: If you register for tournaments through
    GameStop, we may share your registration data with the tournament host and they
    may use it for internal tracking and analytics. For instance, if you give us
    your Xbox Live Gamertag for a Microsoft tournament, Microsoft will use that
    information for internal research.
Sharing with Third Parties. We may share customer information that
    we collect with third parties. Usually, this information will be shared with a
    third party that has relationship with us as a business partner or marketing
    partner (see information on Third-Party Relationships below). Also, we may use
    the information that you provide us, or that we collect about you, in
    connection with the promotion of our products and services and those of our
    affiliates.
Sharing with our Contractors. We also may employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include order
    fulfillment, package delivery, postal mail and email communications, customer lists
    management, data analysis, marketing services and assistance which may include
    content and ads presented on other websites or mobile applications, credit card
    processing, and customer relationship management. These companies and
    individuals have access to personal information needed to perform their
    functions, but they are not permitted to use such information for other
    purposes without our permission. A
    more detailed discussion of our relationship with certain third-party
    advertisers is set forth below under the heading "Third-Party Advertising".
Promotional Offers May be Sent to You. We may call you with or send you offers on behalf of our company or other businesses, or
    permit other businesses that we are working with to call you with or send you offers,
    if we believe that you may be interested in receiving these offers. If, after
    receiving a non-order related email, you do not want to receive such emails in
    the future, you can notify us, by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link
    attached to each email. If after
    receiving a phone call, you wish to no longer receive phone calls from us, you
    can inform the caller or follow the prompt instructions.
Sale or Acquisition of Business Units. As we continue to develop our business,
    we may buy or sell business divisions or companies, we may merge or combine
    with another company, or our company itself, or all or a
    significant part of its assets, may be acquired by another company. We
    may provide any information we have to a potential counter-party in any such
    potential transaction. If such a
    transaction is completed, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred and shared business assets. The information transferred and shared
    remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice
    (unless, of course, the customer has agreed to be subject to new privacy notice
    terms). 
Legal Requirements and Protection of
    our Websites and Others. We may decide to release your account and other personal
    information if we believe release is appropriate or necessary to comply with
    the law, to enforce or apply our website terms of use and other agreements, or
    to protect the rights, property, or safety of our Websites, our users, or
    others. This information may be released or exchanged with other companies and
    organizations to protect against fraud, or for credit risk reduction. We will
    cooperate with law enforcement and judicial authorities, and we may provide
    personally identifiable information to appropriate government authorities upon
    receipt of a subpoena or court order, or to cooperate with a law enforcement
    investigation. We will fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in
    identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We also reserve
    the right to report to law enforcement agencies activities that we in good
    faith believe to be illegal. We undertake no obligation or duty to release such
    information, however, unless we are required to do so under applicable law.
Other Circumstances. If we want to share personal
    information other than as permitted or described above, we will notify you, and
    you may choose to instruct us not to share the information.
Third-Party Relationships
We have several types of third-party
    relationships. 
We offer an affiliate program through a
    third-party affiliate manager. This program allows other websites to earn money
    by directing people (through links) to our Website. If you sign up as an
    affiliate, your contact information (website address and related information,
    email address, mailing and payment addresses, and contact information) is sent
    to the third-party affiliate manager who activates your affiliate status and
    pays you based on the sales you generate for our Websites. You may apply for
    this program using an Affiliate Program application. The Affiliate Program area
    is clearly labeled, and your information is never collected or shared unless
    you also fill out an Affiliate Program application.
We work with business partners to
    provide you access to their products and services. For example, our Website
    includes a link to www.alienware.com. Any information you supply upon entering
    the www.alienware.com site is collected by Alienware.
We link to third-party surveys. When
    you complete a purchase, you are often invited to participate in a survey to
    rate your experience. The survey is conducted by a third party (and is
    identified as such) who shares all of the survey information with us, including
    your email address if you specify it in the survey. We use this information to
    gauge which areas of our service need improving.
If you order from us after visiting
    Sony's Playstation.com web site we will forward your PlayStation Underground
    registration number to Sony along with any information regarding the products
    you have purchased.
Third-Party Advertising:
Advertisements that appear on our
    website are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by
    third-party advertisers with which we have agreements. They automatically
    receive your IP address when this happens. These third-party advertisers may
    also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as
    JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs" or
    "clear gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize
    advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize
    your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness
    of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may
    compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw
    their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked.
    Third-Party Advertisers may also serve advertisements to you on other websites,
    based on their tracking of what content you looked at or interacted with on our
    Websites. GameStop does not have
    access to or control of the cookies and other tracking technologies that may be
    placed by the third-party advertisers. Third-party advertisers have no access
    to your contact information stored by GameStop unless you choose to share it
    with them. 
This privacy policy covers the use of
    cookies by GameStop and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking
    technologies by any of its advertisers.
We use third-party advertising
    companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use
    aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or
    telephone number) about your visits to this and other Websites in order to
    provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you
    would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about
    not having this information used by these companies, please see: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. 

Security of Information Stored by Us
When you purchase something from our
    Websites, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts certain
    purchasing information you input, although no known method of data transfer can
    be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We reveal only the last four digits of your
    credit card number when confirming an order, but we have to transmit the entire
    credit card number to the credit card processor or company during order
    processing.

    To the extent that you use our Websites, and connect to us through your
    computer, anyone with access to your computer may be able to access our
    Websites and conduct transactions in your name. We have no ability to know who
    has access to your computer, or to your credit card information, or who you
    have authorized to use such computer or information. Persons with access to
    your computer may be able to view any private or stored account information or
    other information that you have given to us. Accordingly, you are responsible
    for any transactions that are made in your name by someone who has access to
    your computer or your credit card number. It is important for you to protect
    against unauthorized access to any login or password information, and to your
    computer.

You May Access, Change or Modify Your Personal Information
If you have purchased from us or
    created an account, our site provides you the opportunity to review, correct,
    or update your account information. You can do this by: 
1. Accessing Gamestop.com and clicking on the "My Account"
    link.

 Right to Remove Posted Information - (California Minors)
If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with GameStop or the PowerUp Rewardsâ¢ Program, you have the right to request removal of unwanted information that you publicly post on the GameStop Websites. To request removal of such information, you can contact GameStop at GSContentRequests@gamestop.com. Upon receiving such a request, GameStop will make sure that the information is not publicly available on our Websites, but the information may not be completely or comprehensively removed from GameStop systems. 
 Right to Choose (Opt-Out)
You always may choose not to provide
    information and most Internet browsers allow you to control the automatic
    collection of information from your computer. Obviously, if you choose not to
    provide necessary information, we may not be able to process your orders or
    inquiries. If we permit you to update any information that we store about you,
    we may keep a copy of the previous information for our records.
If, after receiving a non-order related
    email, you do not want to receive such emails in the future, you can notify us,
    by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link attached to each email. 
Do Not Track: Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in
    their web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and
    online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has
    not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals, and,
    therefore, GameStop does not recognize DNT.
Children's Privacy
Our Websites,
    services and applications are designed for and directed at people 13 years of
    age or older. We do not knowingly
    collect information from children under 13. If GameStop learns that a child under
    the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information online in
    contravention of these measures, it will take all reasonable measures to delete
    such information from its databases and to not use such information for any
    purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or other as
    required or allowed by law). If you
    become aware of any personal information we have collected from children under
    13, please contact us at:
Gamestop.com Customer Service
625 Westport Parkway
Grapevine, TX 76051
