Walmart Privacy Policy
Last Updated: March 2015





      En EspaÃ±ol 
    
At
Walmart, our customers are number one â always. Thatâs why everything we do is
focused on providing excellent customer service and delivering low prices. The
information you share with Walmart allows us to provide the products and
services you need and want while giving you the very best shopping experience. 

Our
founder Sam Walton reminded us that âa promise we make is a promise we keep,â
and itâs our promise to customers that we respect the trust you place in us and
the privacy of the information you share. Part of providing superior customer
service includes making sure that weâre building a relationship of trust with
customers.  Our way of doing that is to
let you know in a clear, prominent, and easily accessible way how we collect,
use, share, and above all protect your personal information.  

 Our Policy outlines:

How and why we collect your
     personal information;
How your personal information
     is used and protected;
When and with whom we share
     your personal information; and
What choices you can make
     about how we collect, use, and share your personal information.


What Does Our Privacy Policy Include?
Our
Policy covers how and why we collect, use, protect, and share your personal
information:At Walmart and Amigo retail stores in the United States and Puerto Rico, and On our websites and mobile services where this Policy is posted.

Our Policy focuses on personal information â â
information that identifies you or reasonably can be linked to information that
identifies you.   Learn More
Our Policy covers how and why we collect, use, protect, and
share your personal information. This Policy applies to personal information we
collect at Walmart and Amigo retail stores in the United States and Puerto Rico
and through our websites and mobile services where this Policy is posted. 

Our
Policy focuses on personal information â â information that identifies you or reasonably
can be linked to information that identifies you. For example, when you place
an item on layaway or place an order online, we collect personal information,
such as name, address, phone number, and credit or debit card information.  

We
have additional, specific privacy notices related to some of our specialized
operations. For example, our Health & Wellness operations (pharmacy and vision
center) have a specific Notice of Privacy Practices for their personal
information practices. Our specialized notices can be found here.


What Is Our Pledge of Accountability?
We require our associates, business partners, and service providers to manage your personal information properly. Learn More
We
have designated a team of trained associates who are responsible for helping to
ensure compliance with this Policy. We
require all those who manage customersâ personal information to do so properly
and in accordance with our policies.


What Type of Information Do We Collect?
We collect two types of information: (1) information
we receive from you and (2) information we receive from others.  Information we receive from you includes
information you share with us, such as when you create an account on one of our
websites.  This also includes information
you provide us through technology, such as through a cookie placed on your
computer when you visit our websites.  We
also receive information from other sources to help us supplement our records,
improve the personalization of our service to you, and detect fraud.  Our goal is to limit the information we
collect to the information needed to support our business. Learn More
We
collect information to deliver the products and services you request and to
help improve your shopping experience. Our goal is to limit the information we
collect to the information needed to support our business.  We collect information from you in a variety
of ways when you interact with our stores, websites, and mobile services. We
collect information in two ways: information we receive from you and information
we receive from others.
Information We Receive From You 

You
share information with us in various ways in our stores and online. For
example, you share information when you:

     a mobile shopping list;

     us;

     of our social media pages, or post a rating, review or other
     user-generated content on one of our websites or mobile services; and

     sweepstake, promotion, or survey.


When
you engage in these activities, you may share different types of personal
information with us, such as your name, email address, physical or postal address,
phone number, date of birth, and payment information.

You
also provide us information in other ways through technology. Some of this
information may be linked to you personally. This information helps our
websites and mobile services work correctly and supports our customer marketing
and analytics efforts â â our work to understand our customersâ needs and

     mobile device you use, your device operating system and browser type, a
     unique device identifier, the address of a referring websites, the path
     you take through our websites, and other information about your session on
     our websites.Browsing

     beacons allow us to know if a certain page was visited, an email was
     opened, or if ad banners on our websites and other sites were effective. We

     for you. See âWhat Are Your Choices?â
     below for more information.Location

device is set to provide location information. For example, your deviceâs GPS
signal allows us to show you the nearest Walmart stores. We may be able to

WiFi access.  Through mobile services, Bluetooth
technology in our stores allows us to show you nearby products that may
interest you. See âWhat Are Your Choices?â
below for more information.  Cameras: We
     operate cameras in store for security and operational purposes, for
     example, to help us improve the design of our stores to better serve our
     customers.

supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our service

Marketing
Preferences
When we are sending marketing communications to you, we use the following
standards:

We use an opt-in standard for
     phone and text messages. We use an opt-in standard for sharing personal
     information with companies outside our corporate family of companies for
     their use in direct marketing, such as sending you promotions. Opt-in
     means we will only conduct the activity with your affirmative consent.  
We use an opt-out standard
     for email or for other communications, such as postal mail. Opt-out means
     we may contact you, but will stop upon your request (as described below).


Please
note that these standards may not apply to communications regarding our Health &
Wellness operations, such as prescription reminders. For more information see
the Health
& Wellness Notice of Privacy Practices.

Additionally,
these standards may not apply to Walmart-branded credit card offerings because these
are provided through associated financial institutions. However, you can choose
to stop receiving certain prescreened offers of credit that originate from participating
nationwide credit reporting agencies, including our prescreened offers, by
calling the official Consumer Credit Reporting Industry organization at 1-888-567-8688
or by going to www.optoutprescreen.com.

Preferences & Alerts page. The Communication Preferences & Alerts
page allows you at any time to update or change your preferences about
receiving marketing materials.  Or you

you contact us by email or mail, please be sure to include your full name, the
types of communications you would like to receive or not receive, and your
related contact information. For instance, if you would like to opt-out of
mail, include your mailing address. Please allow sufficient time for your marketing
preferences to be processed. It may take up to ten days to process your
requests related to email and up to 30 days to process your requests related to
telephone calls, text messages, and sharing information with your consent.

may continue to receive mail for six to ten weeks.

such as catalog opt-out services, please communicate your request directly to
us through one of the mechanisms mentioned above.

know that, even if you opted out of receiving marketing communications from us,
we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes. Some
examples are contacts for customer service, product information, service or
reminder notices, customer surveys, or recalls. We may also need to contact you
