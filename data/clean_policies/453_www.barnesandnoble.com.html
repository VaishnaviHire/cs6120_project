For example, we may receive and collect: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the date and time you access the Barnes & Noble Website; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the Barnes & Noble Website. We may also collect information regarding search queries run on the Barnes & Noble Website. We use this information to monitor the usage of the Barnes & Noble Websites and as necessary for our business.Cookies  Like many online retailers, we and/or our third party providers use cookies to recognize you as you use or return to the Barnes & Noble Websites. This is done so that we can personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience. "Cookies" are small files that we place on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on a Barnes & Noble Website. Cookies help us to: (1) speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping bag and provide you with content that is tailored to you; (2) remember information you gave us so that you do not have to re-enter it; (3) determine the effectiveness of some of our and our third party partners' marketing efforts and communications; and (4) monitor the total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of banners displayed.  Browsers are typically set to create cookies automatically. You can choose to have your browser notify you when cookies are being written to your computer or accessed, or you can disable cookies entirely. If you disable cookies, however, you will not be able to place items in a Barnes & Noble Website shopping bag, and therefore you will not be able to place an order with us online. Also, by not using cookies, some Barnes & Noble Website features and services may not function properly.Pixel tags or clear GIFs  We may use sensing technologies that use pixel tags or clear GIFs (which are also called web beacons). These technologies allow us to determine the effectiveness of our e-mail and advertising and marketing efforts. For this purpose, we tie the pixel tags and clear gifs to personally identifiable information. We may also collect information regarding the links within such marketing materials that you click on and purchase statistics regarding items you buy following receipt of such marketing.Third party web analytics services  We work with third party service providers, including but not limited to IBM Coremetrics and Google Analytics, to help us better understand how you use the Barnes & Noble Websites. These third party service providers will place cookies on your computer to collect information such as how you were referred to the Barnes & Noble Website, how you navigate around the Barnes & Noble Website, what you purchase and what traffic is driven by various marketing methods. This information will help us to better serve you and provide you with more personalized information and product offerings. We do not allow third party service providers to collect your credit card information, e-mail address or password information. These third party service providers may only use your personal information to perform services for us and may not share your personal information with anyone else, or use it for any other purpose, except on an aggregated, non-personally identifiable basis.  To learn more about the privacy practices of IBM Coremetrics, you may review its privacy policy located here.   To learn more about the privacy practices of Google, you may review its privacy policy located here. To disable the Google Analytics cookie and other third party web analytics service provider cookies, you can choose to have your browser notify you when cookies are being written to your computer or accessed, or you can disable cookies entirely.Targeted advertising  We may partner with third party advertising networks that collect IP addresses, unique device identifiers (UDIDs), browser type, operating system, time zone, country, referring pages, and other information through the use of cookies, web server logs and pixel tags on Barnes & Noble Websites, Apps, emails and on third party websites and emails. They use this information to provide you with advertisements that are customized to your particular preferences, including for companies that are not affiliated with us. You may see these advertisements on Barnes & Noble Websites and third party websites. We may use this process to help us manage and improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. If you would like to learn more about the third party advertisers that may be aware of the fact that you visit Barnes & Noble Websites, and to understand your opt-out choices, please click here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.  Please understand that Barnes & Noble does not control these third party cookies, and you should check the privacy policies of third party advertising networks to see whether and how it uses cookies.Your Device or Apps you use, including geolocation  When you use a Device or our Apps, we automatically collect information through the Device or App when it is connected to the Internet. For example, we may receive and collect information concerning device registration, settings, usage, firmware version, signal strength, search queries, network interaction, the name of the network from which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the device you are using, unique device identifiers (UDIDs), downloads, sideloaded content, configuration, or service information relating to any malfunction of the Device or App. This may include information regarding your reading, viewing and activity behavior on such Devices or Apps, such as books or videos opened, date and time of use, time elapsed, page turns, bookmarks, annotations, customer reviews, and quiz or test answers.  In addition, to provide location-based services on Devices or through Apps, Barnes & Noble and third party application providers may automatically collect real-time geographic location information or other location-based information about you and your Device or other mobile device on which the App is installed. This information may be used to provide certain device or application functionality or to offer, provide and improve products and services.  To review Barnes & Noble's Mobile Privacy Supplement optimized for reading on mobile devices, please click here.Wireless networks operated by Barnes & Noble in retail stores  When you connect your computer or mobile device to wireless networks operated by Barnes & Noble at store locations, we may collect information concerning your location, unique device identifiers (UDIDs), date and time of access and information regarding your interaction with the Barnes & Noble enterprise through Barnes & Noble Websites, Devices or Apps as permitted by this Privacy Policy.Social networking sites  We may provide you the ability to sign into a Barnes & Noble Website or App using a social networking account such as a Facebook, Twitter or Google account, or use your social networking accounts to share information from Barnes & Noble Websites, Devices or Apps. In these cases, as well as when you use a Barnes & Noble app on a social networking site or choose to join (or "like") a Barnes & Noble page on a social networking site, the social networking site may provide us with certain information about you, including but not limited to your contacts and other "likes". Please see the privacy policy for the applicable social networking site to learn more about how these sites share your personal information.Your college or university  If you rent or purchase textbooks or e-textbooks from Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, we may also collect information about you from your college or university, including but not limited to your mailing and email addresses, class registration information and other course information.

Such information may be collected via, but not limited to, software applications that you download or use on your Device or that otherwise allow you to interact with the Barnes & Noble enterprise.  In certain instances, you may be able to access our goods and services using a Microsoft account without first having to create a password protected Barnes & Noble account. If you are accessing our goods and services using a Microsoft account, Microsoft may share your personal information with us and we will store and use this information to administer the programs and services in which you choose to participate and otherwise as permitted by this Privacy Policy. In most cases, once you have used a Microsoft account to access our goods and services, your Microsoft account will be permanently linked to our services.
