OpenSecrets.org uses temporary session "cookies" (data that is generated on our web server and stored 
            on your computer) for authentication and other purposes. These cookies contain no personally identifiable 
            information and are deleted when the browser window is closed. A user may set his or her browser to disallow

            collect standard log files from our systems to ensure the integrity of our services and for troubleshooting 
            purposes. Included in these log files are the date, the IP address and the URL of the request. Log files are 
            typically deleted from our servers after 90 days. Aggregate information that does not personally identify you 
            may be shared with funders or potential future advertisers.
When this privacy policy is revised or updated, CRP will post the updated version, including the effective 
            date of the revision or update, on OpenSecrets.org. It shall be construed that you accept and agree with the
