The following Privacy Policy applies to your use of all websites, mobile
    applications, and other products and services owned, controlled, operated
    or hosted (whether now or in the future) by JibJab Media Inc. dba JibJab Bros. Studios and/or its
    corporate affiliates, including but not limited to the JibJab.com,
    StoryBots.com, HelloSanta.com, JibJab Messages and all related applications and services (collectively the
    âJibJab Sitesâ).
Privacy Policy
Last Updated: March 1, 2015
This Privacy Policy is an integral part of the agreement between JibJab Bros. Studios (âJibJabâ or âweâ) and each Visitor,
    Registered User, Live Call Purchaser or Member, as the case may be (each,
    a âuserâ or âyouâ) concerning the use of the JibJab
    Sites. The other integral parts of such agreement are the JibJab Terms of
    Service (click here), the JibJab Terms of Sale (click here) and the Legal
    Notices (click here). All capitalized terms used herein that are not
    otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy shall be as defined in the
    JibJab Terms of Service (click here).
At JibJab, we respect your right to privacy and we understand that you
    need to control the uses of your personal information. This Privacy Policy
    details below the measures taken by JibJab to protect your privacy in
    connection with your use of the JibJab Sites. However, you understand that
    the JibJab Sites and JibJab Services allow, among other things, users who
    are 13 or older to post personal content (e.g., photographs and information
    about themselves and others for whom they have the authority or permission
    to post photos and information) for public review and comment, both in
    public forums and with private messaging. Accordingly, by submitting
    personal content for public posting on any of the JibJab Sites or through
    any of the JibJab Services, you hereby waive any and all privacy
    expectations (including the privacy expectations of any other individual
    who appears in your submitted content) with respect to JibJabâs use of such
    content. If you do not wish to have personal content viewable by others,
    you should not submit content for public posting on the JibJab Sites and
    JibJab Services.
JibJab also allows Registered Users and Members to set up unique personal
    profiles either directly with JibJab or via third-party sign-on services
    (e.g., Facebook Connect). To enrich user experience, we request and display
    some personal information to others so as to allow our users to identify
    each other. Registered Users and Members can change their profile
    information at any time and can control how the service communicates with
    them.
By submitting personal information on any of the JibJab Sites or through
    any of the JibJab Services, you affirmatively consent to this Privacy
    Policy and agree to have such personal information (to the extent disclosed
    by you either directly to JibJab or via third-party sign on services)
    collected by JibJab (or its agents or contractors) and transferred to and
    processed in the United States.
Your California Privacy Rights
Effective January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (known
    as the âShine the Lightâ law) provides that, if an individual
    who is a California resident has provided his/her personal information to a
    business in connection with a business relationship that is primarily for
    personal, family, or household purposes, and if that business has within
    the immediately preceding calendar year disclosed such individualâs
    personal information to a third party and knows or should have known that
    such third party used the information for its own direct marketing
    purposes, then that business is obligated to disclose in writing to such
    individual upon request, what personal information was shared and with whom
    the information was shared. A business may comply with this law by: (1)
    having EITHER a published privacy policy of not sharing a customerâs
    personal information for third-party direct marketing use unless the
    customer has first affirmatively opted in to such sharing OR a published
    privacy policy of not sharing a customerâs personal information for
    third-party direct marketing use if the customer has opted out to prevent
    his/her personal information from being shared for third-party direct
    marketing use; AND (2) notifying the customer of his/her right to opt out
    and providing a cost-free means for the customer to exercise that
    right.
California residents may request an information-sharing disclosure from
    us by emailing your request to support@JibJab.com or writing to us
    at JibJab Bros. Studios, Att: Privacy Dept., 13428 Maxella Ave #363,
Marina Del Rey, CA 90292. Please note that, under the law, we are not required to respond to
    your request more than once in a calendar year, nor are we required to
    respond to any requests that are not sent to the above-designated email or
    mailing address.
Do Not Track Disclosure: The JibJab Sites do not currently 
    respond to "Do Not Track" signals of Web browsers. However, should the 
    industry establish uniform technological standards for recognizing and 
    interpreting "Do Not Track" signals, the JibJab Sites would be open to 
    following such industry standards.
Information Collection and Use
JibJab collects user submitted information including but not limited to
    name, email address, and age to authenticate users and to send notifications
    to those users relating to the JibJab Sites and JibJab Services. JibJab may
    also collect other data either directly or via third-party sign-on services
    (e.g., Facebook Connect), including but not limited to: personal interests,
    gender, age, education and occupation, in order to enrich the user
    experience.
JibJab also logs non-personally-identifiable information such as IP
    address, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to
    the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve
    the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be
    shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and
    advertisements to users. User IP addresses may be recorded for security and
    monitoring purposes.
User account information, including pictures and usernames, may also be
    collected and displayed in order to enrich the user experience and
    facilitate user interaction on the JibJab Sites and in email
    communications. Email addresses are primarily used for the purpose of
    sending notifications related to the service. With the exception of
    notifying friends about content the user has created, a user's email
    address is not shared or publicly displayed on the JibJab Sites or within
    the JibJab service. Users' full names, to the extent collected and stored,
    are never directly revealed to other users, unless authorized by the
    user.
We use the email address you provide upon registration to communicate
    with you regarding your account, your purchases and/or other transactions
    with JibJab, changes in our Terms of Service, Terms of Sale and/or Privacy
    Policy, and other matters relating to your account with JibJab. It also
    enables us to send you announcement emails about our new content, features,
    services, products, promotions, etc. You may opt out of receiving
    announcement emails from us at any time, by following the opt-out link
    contained in an announcement email you previously received, or by logging
    into the "My Account" section of the JibJab Site(s) where you have an
    account and changing your email preferences in the account settings.
From time to time, JibJab and one or more of its partners may co-sponsor
    a promotion, sweepstake or contest or may offer a co-branded product or
    service on the JibJab Sites (each, a "Joint Offering"). Users may be asked
    to provide personal information such as name, email address, home address,
    etc. or to answer questions in order to participate in a Joint Offering,
    which personal information may be shared by JibJab with its partners
    involved in such Joint Offering, and such partners may use the information
    for its own advertising and marketing purposes. Also, we may transfer
    personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly
    requested to receive information from.  It will be clear at the point of
    collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy
    statement will apply.
Use of Cookies & Similar Tracking Technologies
A âcookieâ is a small amount of data that is sent to your
    browser from an Internet server and stored in your computer. JibJab uses
    cookies (including Flash cookies) to store user preferences, account status,
    traffic origination, and to record session information, for purposes
    including ensuring that users are not repeatedly offered the same
    advertisements and to customize newsletter, advertising, and Web page
    content based on browser type and user profile information. You may be able
    to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies (other
    than Flash cookies), or notify you when a cookie (other than a Flash
    cookie) is set - each browser is different, so check the âHelpâ
    menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences -
    however, you must enable cookies from JibJab in order to use most functions
    on the JibJab Sites. For more information about Flash cookies and how to
    remove them from your computer, please see the paragraph below entitled
    âSPECIAL NOTE - Flash Cookies.â
JibJab also implements several Google Analytics features that support
    Display Advertising. You may opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising
    and customize Google Display Network ads using the
    Ad Settings or by installing
    the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
JibJab utilizes âRemarketing with Google Analyticsâ to advertise online.
    In addition, third-party vendors, such as Google, show these ads on sites
    across the Internet and JibJab and third-party vendors use both first-party
    and third-party cookies to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on user
    visits to the JibJab site. JibJab also utilizes âGoogle Display Network
    Impression Reportingâ, which uses both first-party and third-party cookies
    to report how ad impressions, uses of ad services, and interactions with
    the ad impressions and ad services are related to user visits to the
    JibJab sites. JibJab also utilizes âDemographics and Interest Reportingâ,
    which collects data based on user demographics and interests, including
    but not limited to: age, gender, affinity category behavior and other
    category behavior. Data collected from the Google Analytics Demographics
    and Interest Reporting function is used in order to enrich the user
    experience and provide more relevant services and advertisements to users.
Some JibJab products may utilize MobileAppTrackingâ¢, a HasOffers Analytics
    tracking service which collects non-personally identifiable user data
    including but not limited to: platform, timestamp, locale, time zone, page
    views, and IP address. JibJab uses this service to collect and compare
    information about the user base and user visits. You are free to opt out
    of this data collection service by going to HasOffers Analyticsâ
    End User Opt-Out page at
    https://www.optoutmobile.com/optout.
In addition, JibJab may use so-called âpixel tags,â
    âweb beacons,â âweb bugs,â âclear
    GIFs,â etc.  (collectively âWeb Beaconsâ) to collect
    information about your visits to the JibJab Sites.  These are small
    electronic images embedded in web content (including online ads) and email
    messages and are ordinarily not visible to users. Like cookies, Web Beacons
    enable us to track pages and content (including ads) accessed and viewed by
    users on the JibJab Sites. Also, when we send HTML-formatted (as opposed to
    plain text) emails to our users, Web Beacons may be embedded in such emails
    to allow us to monitor readership levels so that we can identify aggregate
    trends and individual usage to provide our users with more relevant content
    or offers. Web beacons in emails may recognize activities such as when an
    email was opened, how many times an email was forwarded, which links in the
    email were clicked on, etc.  Web Beacons cannot be declined when delivered
    via a regular web page.  However, Web Beacons can be refused when delivered
    via email. If you do not wish to receive our Web Beacons via email, you
    will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails
    via your email software.
Please note that JibJab may allow thirty-party advertisers (including
    those that are serving their own ads on the JibJab Sites, as well as those
    so-called ânetwork advertisersâ or âad networksâ
    who are serving and managing ads for others) to set and use their own
    cookies (including Flash cookies) and/or Web Beacons on your computer when
    you visit the JibJab Sites. These cookies and Web Beacons allow third-party
    advertisers to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
    advertisement and to compile information about where you, or others who are
    using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are
    clicked on. The information so compiled allows third-party advertisers to
    deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest
    to you. Note, however, that we do not show these types of advertisements to
    our children users or track children users for targeted advertising
    purposes.
Use of cookies (including Flash cookies) and Web Beacons by third-party
    advertisers is governed by the privacy policies of those advertisers - not
    the JibJab Privacy Policy. JibJab has no control over what information is
    collected by third-party advertisers or how they may use the information.

    advertisers may set and use their own Flash cookies for user tracking
    purposes when serving and managing ads on the JibJab Sites.
Invitations and Other Communications to Non-users
JibJab users can send content to friends via our system and invite friends
    to join the service via third-party single sign-on services (e.g., Facebook
    Connect). JibJab may store the email addresses that users provide so that
    JibJab can send notifications authorized by users and related reminders to
    such email addresses. JibJab does not sell these email addresses or use
    them to send any other communication besides those initiated by users and
    invitation reminders initiated by JibJab (one (1) per email address).
    Recipients of emails from JibJab may contact JibJab to request the removal
    of their information from our database by clicking on the
    âOpt-Outâ Link at the bottom of our emails.
You may prevent JibJab messages from being sent to any email address you
    control by sending an email request
    to support@jibjab.com or by visiting and adjusting
    your email preferences in My Account. Please note that the email must come
    from the account you wish to block.
Service Providers
We rely on certain third-party services for the operation of the JibJab
    Sites, such as credit card payment processing, order processing,
    fulfillment and shipment, data storage and security, etc.  To the extent a
    third-party service provider needs to access your information in order to
    perform services to us, we share your information with that provider.  We
    require that a third-party service provider limit its use of your
    information solely to providing services to us and that it maintain the
    confidentiality, security and integrity of your information and not make
    unauthorized use or disclosure of the information.
For example, if you purchase a product from the JibJab online store, we
    use a third-party vendor to pack and ship your order. Our fulfillment
    vendor will be given access to your full name and shipping address solely
    for the purpose of shipping your order. We require our fulfillment vendor
    not to retain, share, store or use your information for any other
    purpose.
As another example, we use Recurly, Inc to provide billing, subscription
    management and other payment related services. When you check out on any of
    the JibJab Sites, you will be asked to enter your First Name, Last Name,
    Credit Card Information, Billing and Shipping Address as necessary to
    complete your transaction. JibJab does not store any payment information in
    our database. Rather, we rely on Recurly, a PCI-DSS Level 1 compliant
    service merchant provider, to store all payment related data. Recurly is
    prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any
    other purpose other than providing the above-described contracted
    services.
Third-Party Sites
The JibJab Sites contain links to third-party sites. Unless expressly
    otherwise stated by JibJab, JibJab is not responsible for the privacy
    policies and/or practices of linked third-party sites. When you leave a
    JibJab Site and go to a third-party site, our Privacy Policy will no longer
    apply, and any information collected from or about you on the third-party
    site will be governed by the privacy policy of that third party.
    Third-party sitesâ privacy policies and data practices may be substantially
    different from those of JibJab.  They may send their own cookies, web
    beacons, etc. to your computer or mobile device, and may collect data about
    you and make use of the data in ways that we would not.  You access such
    third-party sites entirely at your own risk.  You should always read the
    privacy policy of a third-party site before disclosing any personal
    information on that site.
For example, some of the JibJab Sites allow you to check out through
    Paypal.  If you choose to use Paypal, your use of the Paypal service
    (including any personal information you submit to Paypal) is subject to and
    governed by Paypalâs privacy policy, and not JibJabâs.  Also, when you
    purchase a JibJab mobile app from a third-party app store (e.g.,
    Apple/iTunes), your purchase is with the third-party app store and not with
    JibJab, and accordingly, any personal information you submit to the
    third-party app store in connection with the purchase is subject to and
    governed by the privacy policy of the third-party app store, and not
    JibJabâs.
Public Communication
Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post information on the
    JibJab Site(s) that that information can be accessed by the public and can
    in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications. We
    are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose
    to submit in these forums.
We do not currently make available public forums to our children
    users.
Correcting/Updating or Removing Information
JibJab users may modify or remove any of their personal information at
    any time by logging into their account and accessing the âMy
    Accountâ section.
Email Choice/Opt-out
Registered users and members may choose to no longer receive updates or
    notifications by managing their email preferences in the âMy
    Accountâ section of any of the JibJab Sites. All notification emails
    and JibJab newsletters include instructions for opting-out of those
    communications in the future.
Security
JibJab user accounts are secured by user-created passwords and, in some
    cases, third-party sign-on services (e.g., Facebook Connect). JibJab takes
    precautions to ensure that user account information is kept private. We use
    commercially reasonable measures to protect user information that is stored
    within our database, and we restrict access to user information to those
    employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our
    customer service personnel and technical staff. However, we do not
    guarantee that these efforts will completely protect user account
    information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and
    other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.
    We will endeavor to notify users in the event that the security of their
    personal information is breached or compromised. By submitting personal
    information on any of the JibJab Sites, you expressly consent to receiving
    our notification regarding any breach or compromise, or suspected breach or
    compromise, of the security of your personal information, by email or
    postal mail, as we deem appropriate, and as required by law. For any
    additional information about the security measures we use on JibJab, please
    contact us at: support@jibjab.com.
We urge you to keep your username, password, and other account access
    information in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also, remember
    to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have
    finished your visit to a JibJab Site. This is to ensure that others cannot
    access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone
    else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or an
    internet cafe.
Sharing and Disclosure of Information JibJab
    Collects
Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, JibJab will not
    disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that
    disclosure is necessary: (1) to comply with applicable law or to respond to
    a subpoena, court order, search warrant or other legal process received by
    JibJab, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to
    protect or enforce our rights or the rights of a third party; (3) to
    protect the safety of members of the public and our users; or (4) to
    respond to an emergency. JibJab reserves the right to transfer personal
    information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that
    information as a result of a sale of JibJab or substantially all of
    JibJabâs assets to that successor in interest or of a merger between JibJab
    and such successor in interest. JibJab also reserves the right to disclose
    personal information as necessary to enable third-party service providers
    to support and maintain the operation of the JibJab Sites and JibJabâs
    services. You will be notified via e-mail of any such change in ownership
    or control of your personal information. For more information see the
    âChanges in Our Privacy Policyâ section below.
Childrenâs Privacy
JibJab is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we
    encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their childrenâs
    online activities and interests. The JibJab Sites and JibJab Service are
    not intended for use by children under the age of 13 without parental
    supervision. JibJab does not knowingly collect personal information from
    children under the age of 13. Users must be 13 or older to be eligible to
    register on the JibJab Sites.
Some of the JibJab Sites and JibJab Services, such as StoryBots.com, are
    designed for parents and their young children. Children can only access and
    use such sites and services with the participation and supervision of their
    parents. Because of the young age of our children users, only parents are
    allowed to create accounts and profiles and to upload personal content on
    such sites and services. JibJab does not knowingly collect any personal
    information directly from children on such sites and services.  We also
    take certain measures to prevent children from submitting personal
    information to us or from accessing features that may collect or publish
    such information.
If you wish to review or delete any profile information that you have
    provided us regarding a child, or ask that we stop using such information,
    you may do so at any time through the settings area of your account or by
    contacting us using the information below.
Changes in Our Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is subject to change by JibJab from time to time. If
    we make material changes (including material changes in the way we use or
    share user personal information, such as using information for purposes
    materially different from those disclosed in this Privacy Policy), we will
    post the changes on the JibJab Site(s) affected by such changes and notify
    registered users and members via email. Also, we may ask registered users
    and members to review and consent to the changes at the time of their next
    account log-in. By continuing to use the JibJab Site(s) affected by such
    changes after such notice and consent, you agree to be bound by the changes
    to this Privacy Policy.
Contacting the Web Site
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the data practices
    of any of the JibJab Sites, or your dealings with any of the JibJab Sites,
    please contact us via email at support@jibjab.com,
    or via mail at JibJab Bros. Studios, Att: Privacy Dept., 13428 Maxella Ave #363,
