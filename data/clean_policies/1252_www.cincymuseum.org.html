Privacy Policy



  


  
  Cincymuseum.org and all other websites and/or domains hosted in conjunction with this domain (the "Site") are services of Cincinnati Museum Center (âCMCâ), a non-profit organization based in Cincinnati, OH.
Cincinnati Museum Center has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your information and informing you about how we handle your information. This privacy policy applies to all interactions with, transactions made, and data gathered on the Site. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may update it from time to time. This privacy policy was last revised per the date listed below. Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.

Your IP Address
Like most websites, each time you visit the Site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. We use your IP address in order to administer and optimize the Site for you and to diagnose problems with our Site, and, in certain cases, to help identify you.

Cookies
Like most websites, the Site uses cookies to keep track of your purchases and other activity on the Site and enhance your experience on the Site. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password, and if you choose, to save other information so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site. If you wish to disable these cookies, the "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas on the Site.

Information We Collect From You
In order to operate the Site and provide you with information on products and services that may be of interest to you, we may collect personal information (i.e. information that could be used to contact you, such as full name, postal address, phone number and email address), financial information (e.g. passwords and credit card numbers) and demographic information (e.g. zip code, hometown, gender, purchase history information and age) from you. Please note that nowhere on the Site do we knowingly collect personal information from directly children under the age of 13.
