This data is accumulated at the aggregate level.

Tulsaworld.com is continuously assessing how visitors use the site. This data assists us in making decisions about how to improve the site and to better serve our users. Research data are aggregated and do not include data about specific individuals. We may share aggregated research (but not individual user information) with our advertisers or business partners. Additionally, Tulsaworld.com may use your information to contact you to ask for your participation in a focus group, survey, or some other type of research effort.To customize your experience on Tulsaworld.com. As Tulsaworld.com improves its service, it may offer users more opportunities to customize content and other aspects of the site. Information provided by you may be used to assist in the customization process, if you elect to participate in these features.To tailor advertising efforts. Most of the information and services available to you at Tulsaworld.com are free. In order to continue providing services free of charge, Tulsaworld.com sells advertising. Advertisers prefer to target their communication toward audiences who are most likely to be interested in their products. The information gathered on Tulsaworld.com helps us advise advertisers in general terms about certain aspects of site visitors (e.g. how visitors use the site, general demographic attributes of visitors, usage patterns on various parts of our site, etc.). This information helps both advertisers and Tulsaworld.com make better decisions about where to place advertising. This information may also be used to send targeted marketing, such as emails, to users that we think would be interested in such marketing. Visitors who choose to conduct financial transactions with advertisers on Tulsaworld.com may also provide specific data to those advertisers during the process of their transactions. Additionally, any information provided during the purchase of Tulsaworld.com or Tulsa World products or services will result in the collection of certain information required to complete the transaction.To use third party service providers. We provide some services and products through third parties. These third party service providers may perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing promotional emails. We may share your personally identifiable information with such service providers as necessary to allow those service providers to fulfill orders, send mail or email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, or provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies with whom we have business relationships ("Affiliates") and may share your information with service providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. For example, when you order a service, the third party payment processor we use releases your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service.

This information may be from Tulsaworld.com, the Tulsa World, or sent by us on behalf of one of our quality advertisers. Note: If we send you e-mail on behalf of another company, your personally identifiable information is not disclosed to that company unless you purchase a product or service from that company in which case it may need your information to fulfill your purchase. Rather, the company provides us with the information it wants to send, and we prepare and send the e-mail directly to you. We may use a third party service provider to manage or send emails on our behalf, but that third party is only authorized to use your information as necessary to send our email to you and it is not authorized to sell or transfer your information.Postal addresses. If you supply Tulsaworld.com with your postal address, we may send you periodic mailings with information on new products, coming events, surveys or other research materials, or other information we think might be of interest to you.Telephone numbers. If you provide your telephone number or cell phone number, Tulsaworld.com may call or text you regarding orders you have placed online, to tell you about new products, services, or coming events, or to offer other information that may interest you. Additionally, Tulsaworld.com, the Tulsa World or one of their agents may call you for research purposes.Sale transaction information. From time to time, we provide offers from our advertisers who, as part of their offer, request information on customers who purchased their offer in order to allow the advertiser to fulfill the purchase. In those cases, we share some of your personally identifiable information with that advertiser. Sharing this Information may allow that advertiser to market directly to you should it choose to do so. However, we will only share personally identifiable information with an advertiser if you provide us that information and enter into a transaction with that advertiser on or through our Website. We are not responsible or liable for the actions of such advertiser.Business transfer. We may also share your information in the case our business is sold or transferred. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including personally identifiable information.What information is covered by this privacy policy? What isn't?All information you provide directly to Tulsaworld.com is covered under this privacy policy. This information may include but is not limited to personally identifiable information such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.Information that you might post on a message board, forum, or chat room is not protected under this privacy policy.
